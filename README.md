### Titanium RSS Viewer Example ###

Just a quick custom demo of an RSS feed reader in Appcelerator Titanium, using compiled CoffeeSCript.
Disclaimer: Only tested build as a mobile web app from Titanium Studio.

## Instructions ##

Replace the contents of the "Resources" directory in a new Titanium project with the contents of this repository.

Build and run in Titanium Studio.

A tip for running locally in a web browser with an externally-hosted RSS feed:
Disable your browser's security policy blocking cross-domain JavaScript XMLHttpRequest's since it's likely that the server is blocking your local IP/domain via the Access-Control-Allow-Origin HTTP header.
